The `Goal` of the competition is to help `researchers better understand` the `ability of LLMs` to test themselves, and the `potential of LLMs` that can be run in resource-constrained environments.\n","\n","The `dataset` for the competition was generated by giving `gpt3.5 snippets` of text on a range of `scientific topics pulled` from `Wikipedia`, and asking it to `write a multiple choice question` (with a known answer), then `filtering out easy questions`.\n","\n","`Participants` in the competition are asked to `develop an LLM` that can `answer the questions` in the dataset `as accurately as possible`. The competition is scored using the `average precision` at `cutoff k metric`, where $k$ is the `number of predictions` made for each question.\n","\n","An estimations shays that the `largest models` run on `Kaggle` are around $10$ $Billion$ $Parameters$, whereas `gpt3.5 clocks` in at $175$ $Billion$ $Parameters$. If a `question-answering model can ace` a test written by a `question-writing model` more than $10$ `times its size`, this would be a genuinely `interesting result`; on the `other hand` if a `larger model can effectively` `stump a smaller one`, this has `compelling implications` on the `ability of LLMs` to benchmark and test themselves.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e2008be9","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.02539,"end_time":"2023-07-24T10:04:12.900351","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-24T10:04:12.874961","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <p style=\"font-family:JetBrains Mono; font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 2px; color:#0000FF; font-size:140%; text-align:left;padding: 0px; border-bottom: 3px solid #0000FF\">1 | Advisory 💡 </p>\n","\n","<div style=\"border-radius:10px; border:#92DFF3 solid; padding: 15px; background-color: #92DFF#; font-size:100%; text-align:left\">\n","\n","* This is a $Multi-Label$ $Classification$ $Problem$\n","* The evaluation will not be done for $1$ value but rather than multiple values.

$Summarization$\n","* Translation$\n","* $Question$ $Answering$\n","* $Code$ $Generation$\n","This makes it `more versatile` than $T5$, which is only trained on text-to-text tasks.\n","\n","$Flan-T5$ has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, including\n","* $MMLU$ $Multi-Task$ $Few-Shot$ $Learning$ $Understanding$ - $75.2$%\n","* $GLUE$ $General$ $Language$

The `tokenizer` is responsible for `splitting text` into `tokens`, which are the basic units that the language model understands. The tokenizer also assigns `each token a unique ID`, which allows the language model to refer to the tokens later.\n","\n","The $Falcon$ $7B$ Tokenizer is based on the `GPT-3 Tokenizer`, but it has been modified to work with the $Falcon$ $7B$ language model. The tokenizer includes a `number of features` that are designed to `improve the performance` of the language model, such as:\n","\n","* $Support$ $Unicode$ $Characters$ - The tokenizer `supports` a wide range of `Unicode characters`, which allows it to handle text in a variety of languages.\n","* $Efficient$ $Tokenization$ - The tokenizer is `designed to be efficient`, so it can be used to tokenize large amounts of text quickly.\n","* $Robust$ $Error$ $Handling$ - The tokenizer `includes a number of features` that help to prevent errors, such as handling invalid characters and out-of-vocabulary words."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":28,"id":"3ba6736c","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-24T10:07:02.973764Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-24T10:07:02.972653Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-24T10:07:05.365295Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-24T10:07:05.364393Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.426841,"end_time":"2023-07-24T10:07:05.367838","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-24T10:07:02.940997","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"929f20f2276347bfa13f0ecf20577fb6","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading (…)okenizer_config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/220 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"ef4527c37bc74ad3becea833d813dd88","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading (…)/main/tokenizer.json:   0%|          | 0.00/2.73M [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"363502e2fc1444a3b17d01c4e83b43ad","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading (…)cial_tokens_map.json:   0%|          | 0.00/281 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["falcon_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"tiiuae/falcon-7b\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":29,"id":"ed1e80b9","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-24T10:07:05.432058Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-24T10:07:05.431617Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-24T10:07:05.441372Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-24T10:07:05.440307Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.04467,"end_time":"2023-07-24T10:07:05.443541","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-24T10:07:05.398871","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["{'input_ids': [49366, 100], 'token_type_ids': [0, 0], 'attention_mask': [1, 1]}"]},"execution_count":29,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["falcon_tokenizer(\"Yayy\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2f0f4acf","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.030538,"end_time":"2023-07-24T10:07:05.504951","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-24T10:07:05.474413","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<div style=\"border-radius:10px;
