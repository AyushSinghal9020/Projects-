It is set in a narrative framework of a dialogue between the `Pandava prince Arjuna` and his guide and `charioteer Krishna`. The `Gita` explores a range of `philosophical topics`, such as the `nature of reality`, `the self`, `the soul`, and the `relationship between action and duty`. It also contains teachings on `yoga, meditation, and devotion`.\n","\n","\n","$GPT-0$ is a `small`, `simple language model` that was created by `OpenAI` in $2020$. It is a `generative pre-trained transformer` model that was trained on a dataset of text and code. `GPT-0` is `not as powerful` as some of the other language models that have been created by `OpenAI`, but it is still a `valuable tool for research and development`. `GPT-0` has been used to generate text, translate languages, and answer questions. It has also been used to create new forms of art and music. `GPT-0` is a powerful tool that has the potential to change the way we interact with computers\n","\n","Today we will try to build our own `GPT-0` trained on the `Bhagavad Gita`, and see the results"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"bd7dd238","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-17T13:18:37.371525Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-17T13:18:37.370793Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-17T13:18:37.381564Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-17T13:18:37.380708Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.031853,"end_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:37.383801","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:37.351948","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np \n","import pandas as pd "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"afeaefd5","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-17T13:18:37.421307Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-17T13:18:37.420763Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.222999Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.221748Z"},"papermill":{"duration":3.824869,"end_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.226167","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:37.401298","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","from torch.nn import functional as F"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"6c8f9efe","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.264895Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.263507Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.274464Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.273558Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.032414,"end_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.277008","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.244594","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/kaggle/input/bhagwat-gita-in-english/bhagvadnew.txt\n","/kaggle/input/bhagwat-gita-in-english/gita.txt\n"]}],"source":["import os\n","for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n","    for filename in filenames:\n","        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"863b3b00","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.017516,"end_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.312314","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.294798","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# 1 | Data 🚀\n","\n","Lets get our data into working "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"362647fd","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.350486Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.350043Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.359188Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.358366Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.031553,"end_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.361568","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.330015","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["with open('/kaggle/input/bhagwat-gita-in-english/gita.txt', \n","          'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n","    text = f.read()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"74f46f34","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.01737,"end_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.396718","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.379348","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["So our data is a text and it basically looks like this"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"8f8019e3","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.434119Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.433467Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.445502Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.444647Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.039902,"end_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.454248","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-17T13:18:41.414346","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":[" I\n","Dhritirashtra:\n","Ranged thus for battle on the sacred plain--\n","On Kurukshetra--say, Sanjaya! say\n","What wrought my people, and the Pandavas?\n","\n","Sanjaya:\n","When he beheld the host of Pandavas,\n","Raja Duryodhana to Drona drew,\n","And spake these words: \"Ah, Guru! see this line,\n","How vast it is of Pandu fighting-men,\n","Embattled by the son of Drupada,\n","Thy scholar in the war!
